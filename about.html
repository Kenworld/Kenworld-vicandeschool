                    <h2>VIKANDE KIDS SCHOOL</h2>
                    <p> The genesis of the vision dates back to the year 1989. The school began at Asuoyeboa, a suburb in Kumasi with an enrolment of only twelve (12) pupils within Kwadaso – Asuoyeboa enclave.</p>
                </div>
                <p>In the years 1991-1993, further growth and development led to the acquisition of ten acres of land to the permanent sites at Apatrapa.</p>
                <p>In 1996, the school reached the JHS level. In 1999, the fourteen (14) pioneers of the school took the 1st Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) and came out with numerous distinctions which placed the school in the number one (1) position in the Kumasi Sub-Metro. We were pronounced the best school on the academic group table in our Kumasi Metropolitan. (Now Kwadaso Municipality).</p>
                <p>The pioneers thereby set the tone and standard for a tradition of academic excellence and moral discipline which have been the hall mark of the school to date</p>
                <p>Vicande School was established in 4th September, 1989 under the auspice of the late Mr. Kwame Oduroe Afriyie Korankyi (aka Master) the wife Mrs. Victoria Oduroe Nyande (aka Mama Vicande). The school is famous for academic excellence and moral discipline. The School has developed very rapidly and overtaken many of the old well-endowed public and private schools in the quality of facilities and examination results.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the school was established as a limited guaranteed company, to oversee the educational support of academic excellence and moral discipline by providing distinctive God-centered inclusive and Learner-friendly (operating in the best interests of our learners) basic education in a benign and supportive under a conducive environment, whilst developing responsible global citizens for the future. </p>
                <p>In addition, Vicande School has held steadfast to its reputation as a manager of a prestigious confederation of schools delivering first-class basic education in Ghana. Though professionally recognized in 1999, the school has built a sturdy thirty – four (34) years track record of establishing individual schools since 1989. </p>
                <p>Presently, one fully functional mainstream school has been established in the same location within Kwadaso municipality to offer unbeatable Christian education and support to the municipal. Today, Vicande School can boast of over seven hundred (700+) pupils, sixty (60+) teachers and fourty (40+) non- teaching staff Asuoyeboa in its mainstream school.</p>
                <p>Vicande School flames that was ignited in the terrain of the Ghana Education Service (GES) system with a model has shined into a powerful and robust brightness serving as a centre of academic excellence and moral discipline in the country and the international community, accessing both local and international universities, living her vision to be the major brand name as far as academic excellence and total moral training are concerned.</p>
                <p>Vicande School is blessed with a team of well refined and experienced personalities who serve as Executive Management Team (EMT) of the School; Mr. Godwin Oduro (Pharmacist, UK / CEO Vicande School: Board Chairman), Mr. Kwaku Oduro Frikyi (Executive Director: Board Member), Mr. Dickson Amankwah Opanbour (Financial Consultant: Board Member), Mr. Michael Ackah-Ewiah (Accountant: Board Member), Mr. Nimo-Asante Kwame Charles (Headmaster: Board Member), Mr. Samuel Kwasi Ackah Aggrey (Assist. Headmaster, Acadamic: Board Member), Mr. Patrick Adusei Yeboah (Board Member) Mr. Malik Djire (Board Member), Mr. Murtala Ali Gali Mohammed (Board Member) Mr. Richmond Quaye (Board Member), and Madam Francisca Nambu (Board Member). Indeed, it is a huge privilege to have these very accomplished industry players serve on the School’s Board, and for me, it is a blessing to directly receive the benefits from the knowledge they share. </p>
                <p>We will eternally remain grateful to the Board, and we treasure the diversified, tangible, prudent and reliable investments they have made over the years in guiding us in achieving many successes, including growing the school’s enrollment to over 70% in twenty-five (25) years, and winning two (2) desirable Presidential Awards during the same period. </p>
                <p>It’s always exciting to note that Vicande School’s BECE results has consistently been the best in the Ashanti Region, and among Ghana’s top ten results since 1999. But we do not only take pride in excellent results. As already mentioned, we produce the best harvest of well behaved, God-fearing and moral disciplined learners who are impregnated with the 21st Century Skills of critical thinking, good communication skills, creativity, perseverance, problem solving, collaboration, information and digital literacy, innovation, and, learners who are globally-aware, and ready to make a difference wherever they find themselves after completing the School. It is not surprising that among the over five thousand alumni of the school, majority of them are engaged in very reputable units; parliament of Ghana, the mining industry, educational sector, health sector, financial sector, information and communication technology, aviation, oil and gas, among others. Hitherto, many more are self-made entrepreneurs, and we are proud of their contributions to the Ghanaian and worldwide economy.</p>
                <p>Our school is among the fewest educational institutions that prioritize and actually undertake corporate social responsibilities to the benefit of the needy and poor in society. Through our corporate social responsibilities obligation, we have over the years donated books, furniture, clothing, sanitary items, computers, and in some instances, cash, to orphanages, less-endowed basic schools in the Kumasi Metropolis. In prolongation of this commitment, Vicande School has provided full scholarships for brilliant-but-needy students and so far, the school has spent thousands of dollars on scholarships to enroll about fifty students from Kwadaso Municipality.</p>
                <p>It is our greatest anticipation that our school, Vicande School, becomes a Community of its own, not one of academic ideal, but one which offers a diversity of amazing academic influence and skills, and one which will over a long period continue to produce efficacious people.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, we are intent that in order to make our Vision and Mission a reality, Management should, and will consistently operate discipline and the enforcement of the school’s rules and regulations as the linking thread intertwining through the complex embroidery of the school’s cloth. Once more, the Executive Management Team wishes to express great appreciation to parents and guardians for the support and trust since 4th September, 1989. Also, we appreciate very much, the generosity and kindness of some parents and guardians who have helped to improve the quality of services in the school. We say God bless you all and thank you very much. </p>

            <h4 class="mb-4 display-6 text-center">Boarding</h4>
            <p>Currently our School boasts of three boarding houses situated in serene environment that provides an exceptional atmosphere for learning and growth. Our boarding system offers a place of an unwavering commitment to academic excellence, moral discipline, generation of passion for learning, leadership, success, cross-cultural appreciation and religious upbringing. The school has two separate boarding houses for boys and one for girls. </p>
            <p>The student population in our boarding houses is three hundred and forty. During our mid-term breaks, the school organizes excursions for all the learners to tour some scenic spots in Ghana. </p>
            <p>Significantly, our dormitories are spacious, airy and constructed to accommodate few inmates in order to avoid over-crowding. </p>
            <p>The boarding house is headed by very dedicated personnel and a team of able and equally dedicated housemasters, housemistresses and housekeepers. </p>
